## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  I want to create a Help Desk Support Ticketing system. The ticketing system will serve as an organization tool for
Help Desk Agents to create/manage their tickets opened by end users. Each ticket will be be associated with an ID # in
which requesters can refer to when asking for status updates. Help Desk Agents will have a to create a log in while I would
like to have a separate admin log in with different priveldges for supervisors. EX: A supervisor would be able to add/remove
a category from the categories tab while an agent would not have that option.
### Features
User Log in- Users will create a log in and have a dashboard displaying all of their tickets.
Admin Log in- Will be able to the list of agents and view their tickets. They will be able to edit certain fields like adding or removing categories.
